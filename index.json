A markup language is a set of codes that, when applied to plain text, allows you to add one or more of the following properties (among others):\nDefine Text Structure text Describe text layout Decorate text  One markup language that you come across every day (unless you‚Äôre a hermit) is Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML. The websites and applications that bring you news and show you your email are built, at least in part, with HTML markup, using tags as a mechanism to mark up raw text content. For example, consider the following HTML snippet:\nCode If you wanted to take advantage of markup languages, for example by publishing an HTML page on the web or converting a DocBook file to PDF so it can be printed, you had to do one of two things. On the one hand, you can spend time learning these languages ‚Äã‚Äãinside and out, writing them down by hand, and then triple-checking your work. Or you could invest in a tool that manages the difficulty for you. Luckily, some enterprising developers have come up with a third option. They created new markup languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat contained many (in some cases most or all) of the features of their heavier counterparts, but greatly simplified the syntax. These ‚Äúlight‚Äù languages ‚Äã‚Äãinclude the familiar Markdown as well as Asciidoc, the Egc format in Org mode, and the Mediawiki syntax.\nStory ###Story\nLightweight markup languages ‚Äã‚Äãwere originally used on text displays that could not display italicized or bold characters, so informal methods had to be developed to communicate this information. This formatting choice has naturally been applied to plain text emails. Console browsers may also use similar rendering conventions.\nIn 1986, the international standard SGML provided a means to define and parse lightweight markup languages ‚Äã‚Äãusing grammars and tag implication. 1998 W3C XML is an SGML profile that lacks these features. However, the SGML Document Type Definition (DTD) for any of the languages ‚Äã‚Äãlisted below is not known.\nTypes Lightweight markup languages ‚Äã‚Äãcan be categorized by their tag types. Similar to HTML (bold), some languages ‚Äã‚Äãuse named elements that have a common format for start and end tags (e.g. BBCode [b] bold [/b]), while proper simplified markup languages ‚Äã‚Äãare limited to ASCII-only punctuation and others non-letter characters for tags, but some also mix both styles (eg Textile bq.) or allow inline HTML (eg Markdown ), possibly extended with custom elements (eg MediaWiki source).\nMost languages ‚Äã‚Äãdistinguish between markup for lines or blocks and shorter sections of text, but some only support inline markup.\nSome markup languages ‚Äã‚Äãare designed for a specific purpose, such as documenting computer code (eg POD, RD ) or converting to a specific output format (usually HTML) and nothing else, others more generally in an application. This includes whether they are oriented towards text representation or data serialization.\nPresentation oriented languages ‚Äã‚Äãinclude AsciiDoc, atx, BBCode, Creole, Crossmark, Epytext, Haml, JsonML, MakeDoc, Markdown, Org-mode, POD, reST, RD, Setext, SiSU, SPIP, Xupl, Texy!, Textile, txt2tags, UDO and Wikitext.\nData serialization-oriented languages ‚Äã‚Äãinclude Curl (homoicon but also reads JSON; each object is serialized), JSON, and YAML.\nCompare language features The native Markdown syntax does not support class attributes or id attributes; however, since Markdown supports including native HTML, these features can be implemented using straight HTML. (Some extensions may support these features.) The native txt2tags syntax does not support class attributes or id attributes; however, since txt2tags supports including native HTML code in tagged areas, these features can be implemented using straight HTML when stored in the target HTML.\nSimplified markup language syntax comparison –•–æ—Ç—è –æ–±—ã—á–Ω–æ –¥–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –≤—ã–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç–∞ –∫—É—Ä—Å–∏–≤–æ–º –∏ –ø–æ–ª—É–∂–∏—Ä–Ω—ã–º —à—Ä–∏—Ñ—Ç–æ–º, –±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ –æ–±–ª–µ–≥—á–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ø—Ä–æ—Ü–µ—Å—Å–æ—Ä–æ–≤ —Ä–∞–∑–º–µ—Ç–∫–∏ –≤—ã–≤–æ–¥—è—Ç —Å–µ–º–∞–Ω—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —ç–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã HTML em–∏ —Å–∏–ª—å–Ω—ã–π–≤–º–µ—Å—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ. –ú–æ–Ω–æ—à–∏—Ä–∏–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏ –ª–∏–±–æ –∫ —Å–µ–º–∞–Ω—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–º—É –∫–æ–¥—É, –ª–∏–±–æ –∫ –ø—Ä–µ–∑–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–º —ç–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–º tt. –ù–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ —è–∑—ã–∫–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–æ–¥—è—Ç —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–∏–µ, –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä –¢–µ–∫—Å—Ç–∏–ª—å, –∏–ª–∏ –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª–∏—Ç—å –ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—é –ª–µ–≥–∫–æ –Ω–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç—å –≤—ã–≤–æ–¥, –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä Texy.\nLML –∏–Ω–æ–≥–¥–∞ —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–∞—é—Ç—Å—è —Ä–∞–∑–º–µ—Ç–∫–æ–π –∏–∑ –Ω–µ—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–∏—Ö —Å–ª–æ–≤, –≥–¥–µ –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ —Ç—Ä–µ–±—É—é—Ç, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª—ã —Ä–∞–∑–º–µ—Ç–∫–∏ –∑–∞–º–µ–Ω—è–ª–∏ –º–µ–∂—Å–ª–æ–≤–Ω—ã–µ –ø—Ä–æ–±–µ–ª—ã (–∏–Ω—Ñ–∏–∫—Å). –î–ª—è –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö —è–∑—ã–∫–æ–≤ —Ç—Ä–µ–±—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –æ–¥–∏–Ω —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª –≤ –∫–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ –ø—Ä–µ—Ñ–∏–∫—Å–∞ –∏ —Å—É—Ñ—Ñ–∏–∫—Å–∞, –¥–ª—è –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏—Ö - —É–¥–≤–æ–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏–ª–∏ –¥–∞–∂–µ —É—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏–ª–∏ –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∫–∞ –æ–±–æ–∏—Ö —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª–æ–≤ —Å –Ω–µ–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏–º –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º, –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã–µ —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–∏ –∞–∫—Ü–µ–Ω—Ç–∞.\n–°–∏–Ω—Ç–∞–∫—Å–∏—Å –∑–∞–≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–∫–∞ –ó–∞–≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–∫–∏ –æ–±—ã—á–Ω–æ –¥–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–Ω—ã –Ω–∞ —à–µ—Å—Ç–∏ —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω—è—Ö, –Ω–æ –≤–µ—Ä—Ö–Ω–∏–π —á–∞—Å—Ç–æ –∑–∞—Ä–µ–∑–µ—Ä–≤–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω –¥–ª—è —Ç–æ–≥–æ, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã —Å–æ–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞—Ç—å —Ç–æ –∂–µ —Å–∞–º–æ–µ, —á—Ç–æ –∏ –∑–∞–≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–æ–∫ –¥–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –±—ã—Ç—å —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω –∏–∑–≤–Ω–µ. –í –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö –¥–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ö —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–∏ –º–æ–≥—É—Ç –±—ã—Ç—å —Å–≤—è–∑–∞–Ω—ã —Å —Ç–∏–ø–∞–º–∏ –ø–æ–¥—Ä–∞–∑–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–π, –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä —á–∞—Å—Ç—å, –≥–ª–∞–≤–∞, —Ä–∞–∑–¥–µ–ª, —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å—è –∏–ª–∏ –∞–±–∑–∞—Ü. ‚Ä¶","date":1649376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649376000,"objectID":"07e02bccc368a192a0c76c44918396c3","permalink":"https://example.com/post/writing-technical-content/","publishdate":"2022-04-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/writing-technical-content/","section":"post","summary":"Lightweight Markup Languages: This is Why You Should Use AsciiDoc Instead of Regular Markdown\nWhat is a ‚Äúmarkup language‚Äù?

Changes made by a developer are verified by creating an assembly and running automated tests on that assembly. With this approach, you avoid the hassle of integrating when you have to wait for release day to merge changes in the relevant branch.\nWhen using continuous integration, a lot of attention is paid to test automation, as a result of which, when integrating new commits into the main branch, the application does not break.\nContinuous supply Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration because it automatically deploys all code changes to the test and/or production environment after the build step.\nThis means that not only the testing process is automated, but also the product release process, so the application can be deployed at any time with one click.\nTheoretically, with continuous delivery, you can release daily, weekly, every two weeks, or any other business-relevant frequency. However, if you really want to take advantage of continuous delivery, you should deploy to production as early as possible, ensuring that small patches are released that are easy to find bugs in case of problems.\nContinuous deployment Continuous Deployment goes one step further than Continuous Delivery. With this approach, every change that goes through all stages of the production pipeline is released to customers. No human intervention is required, and only an error during a test can prevent a new change from being deployed to production.\nContinuous Deployment is a great way to speed up the customer feedback cycle and take the pressure off your team by canceling the ‚Äúrelease day‚Äù. Developers can focus on creating software. They see how their code is launched in minutes, as soon as it is finished.\nHow do these approaches relate to each other Simply put, continuous integration is part of both continuous delivery and continuous deployment. And continuous deployment is similar to continuous delivery, except that releases happen automatically. Continuous Deployment\nThis post was created with Jupyter.
